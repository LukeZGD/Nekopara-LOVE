# Nekopara-Vita

This is an attempt of "porting" Nekopara Vol. 1 to LOVE2D, so it will run on PS Vita with LOVE-OneLua.

Most of the code is based on [DDLC-LOVE](https://github.com/LukeZGD/DDLC-3DS/tree/ddlclove).

This needs the extracted assets from data.xp3, evimage.xp3, and voice.xp3 from the original game. You can extract these with [KrkrExtract](https://github.com/xmoeproject/KrkrExtract/blob/master/OldVersion/1.0.3.1/).
